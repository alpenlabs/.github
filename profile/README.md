We're expanding global financial access
& individual agency through ZK-enabled infrastructure on bitcoin.

[**Alpen**](https://alpenlabs.io) gives developers the freedom to program nearly
any locking conditions for BTC imaginable,
limited only by the Alpen block size and gas limits.
This enables developers to create new kinds of applications for BTC
with features such as:

- **New signature types**, "provide a valid `P-256` signature to authorize a transfer"

- **Vaults**, "transfers must wait `N` days after being initiated to be effectuated,
  and can be cancelled in the mean time"

- **Subscriptions**, "address `0x123...9a` can withdraw up to `v` BTC 
  per month from this account"

- **Strong privacy**, "transaction details are end-to-end encrypted
  and verified using a zero-knowledge proof"

- **Economically-secured zero-confirmation payments**,
  "if a double-spend from this sender is reported,
  the reporter gets to claim the sender's full wallet balance"

- **Financial transactions**,
  "if enough BTC is locked as collateral to maintain up
  to `X%` loan-to-value ratio,
  then up to N of this other asset can be borrowed"

... and many more possibilities.
